## README

This is the code for the Visual Studio Code Extension what the kaze-cli uses.

The current version of **kaze-vscode-extension** code has some software dependencies that can not be currently resolved due to restricted access. For this reason, in this version you cannot build **kaze-vscode-extension** from the source code. Nevertheless, in the **dist** folder you will have access to two packaged distributions of **kaze-vscode-extension** ready to be used, one for Linux systems and another for Mac systems. Enjoy yourself!
